# Basketball Training with Pose Detection

This project is designed to assist with basketball training by using the [TFJS Pose Detection][posedetection] model, specifically the [MoveNet.SinglePose.Ligntning][tfhub] model, in an Expo project with [TFJS React Native][tfjs-react-native]. 

The application calculates relevant angles and movements to provide real-time feedback on your basketball training exercises. It supports both portrait and landscape mode with front and back camera. The demo only renders the keypoints, providing a clear and concise visual representation of your pose.
